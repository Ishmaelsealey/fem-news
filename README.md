### What I learned

I learnt that I can significantly reduce the time I spend coding a project by doing a diagram of how I
plan to accomplish the intended design.

The night before I made the image below and it greatly helped me figure out how I would do the project,
so I spent less time thinking and more doing!

It my look like chaos to others, but to the one who created it, it makes complete sense.
