### What I learned

I learnt that I can significantly reduce the time I spend coding a project by doing a diagram of how I
plan to accomplish the intended design.

The night before I made the image below and it greatly helped me figure out how I would do the project,
so I spent less time thinking and more doing!

It my look like chaos to others, but to the one who created it, it makes complete sense.
Let me explain:

- The elements are numbered 1 through 6 (except the header). This reflects the order the elements will appear in the html file
- Blue boxes outline the biggest containers I will have and black lines outline where blocks start and end.
  - these also outline where I expect my grid to be
  - This helps me see which elements will span multiple columns or rows in the case of element 1 and element 4.
- the h1 through 3 tags help me see what tags I anticipate wil lbe used
- The red box outlining everything is there simply to show that there will be space around the main content.
  - margin meant that I would have to add margin the the header and main body tags, I would also have to keep track of how much left and right margin was added to keep the spacing identical
  - padding meant that I would add padding to the body tag, easier to keep consistent between header and main
